  <p> I am <em>very</em> nervous about graduating this upcoming May.  It is very scary to head into the real world.  I am hoping to get a job somewhere in the business world, though I am also open to a position at a charity organization.  I would really like to nail down a position somewhere <strong>soon</strong>.  It is very stressful looking for a position!  I want to do something that I can enjoy, make a career out of, and enjoy for the rest of my life!
