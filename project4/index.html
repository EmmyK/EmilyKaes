  <p> I am <em>very</em> nervous about graduating this upcoming May.  It is very scary to head into the real world.  I am hoping to get a job somewhere in the business world, though I am also open to a position at a charity organization.  I would really like to nail down a position somewhere <strong>soon</strong>.  It is very stressful looking for a position!  I want to do something that I can enjoy, make a career out of, and enjoy for the rest of my life!

  <p>"Saturday appeared to be a trigger-happy day for police in the United States as officers opened fire against unarmed men in two different states. One ended tragically, the other bizarre encounter could have ended much worse."</p>
      <p>On Saturday in NYC, cops shot and killed an apparent car accident victim who was just looking for help.  He had been looking for help at a nearby apartment when the apartment's occupant called the police about a strange man.  The police responded to the call and shot the man when he started toward them.  He died.  
        Also on Saturday, in North Carolina, cops accidentally missed their target and shot two ladies.  One in the butt and one in the leg.  Both women are fine.</p>
